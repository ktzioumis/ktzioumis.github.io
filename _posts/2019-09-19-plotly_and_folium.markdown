During a recent project based on [New York City Restaurants](https://github.com/ktzioumis/New-York-Restaurant-Guide) I wanted to create some maps. It seemed to me like a useful thing to have on hand when talking about a city and they were very illustrative.The project ended up incorporating three maps based around New York Community Board Districts:
- Density of restaurants
- Most popular types of restaurants, 
- Average health department inspection scores,

But there was one map that I made but I didn't end up using - Year on year changes in health dept inspection score averages. For a few reasons, including the overall sprawl over the project at this point, I did not end including an analysis of time as a influencing factor on health department inspection scoring and grading. It was just as well because as much as I liked the idea behind that map, I didn't like the way it turned out.

You can view and interact with it here: https://ktzioumis.github.io/plotly-folium/m_ave_yronyr.html

The map displays the annual average health inspection score for each Community Board area for the years 2016 (from july),  2017,2018 & 2019 (to july).
