Learning a new skill is hard but I think we can all agree usually worthwhile.

I have wanted to learn a coding language for a while, but building websites and simple interactive games never captured my interet and or held my attention. On a whim, after losing interest in a JavaScript tutorial, I started a free, intro to python for data science. I found it interesting enough manipulating lists and dictionaries, the lessons devloped into doing analysis on data sets and instead of losing interest I became much, MUCH more interested. Using data to tell a story and using the python code to puzzle out the data was fascinating. I went through the free intro course and found another, and another. I was fascinated, learning to code through interactions with real datasets meant I didn't just learn tools and skills for manipulating and alaysing data I got to puzzle out a little story at the same time. Every passenger that lived and died on the Titanic, very easy to sink into! Movie box office figures, a reel draw! Collected wine reviews, drank it up! 

Learning data sciece though isn't just about learning a skill for the sake of learning a skill. Data science is a booming industry. Its hard not to notice, data is collected at a rate never seen before. And as the datasets increase exponentially so too does the need for someone to do *something* with it. The need for data scientists across industries is evident in headlines like[ "LinkedIn's Fastest-Growing Jobs Today Are In Data Science And Machine Learning"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2017/12/11/linkedins-fastest-growing-jobs-today-are-in-data-science-machine-learning/#7953aff351bd). Now, we are told, is the time to get in on the gold rush. A career in a a growing techbased field has plenty of perks. These are well paying jobs, they have excellent benefits packages and room for advancement. They can be flexible too, this is important when you have a family, tech industry jobs often have work from home or remote accessing potential. 

Enjoying the learning process, upskilling into a career doing something I find fascinating, joining a growing and in-demand tech industry. This is why I am learning Data Science
