This blog post will explore the visual aspect of exploratory data analysis using King's County Housing Prices dataset.

A big part of exploratorty data analysis is visualisation. Thousands of rows of data can expresssed simultaneously as points, lines, bars, areas and many other forms and this is very useful for identifying and exploring trends or important aspects of the data set. Once the data set has been cleaned of missing values, one of the first steps of exploratory data analysis that we have been shown is to generate histograms of each feature. Using pandas this can be done simply with the command df.hist()
