Seinfeld is and always has been one of my all time favourite shows, so when I saw the complete ['Seinfeld Chronicles'](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles) data set on Kaggle I was speechless, I had no speech.

The dataset contains both the complete scripts for every episode and episode meta-data such as writers and airdate. Together I was able to use these to explore a few intersting pieces of Seinfeldia
